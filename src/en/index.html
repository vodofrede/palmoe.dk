                        This project makes use of fundamental web technologies
                        such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The
                        lack of good build planning tools for the game Elden
                        Ring made me embark on this project,
                        which consists of simple calculators for characters
                        statistics, armor efficiency and weapon
                        damage. Beyond the simple calculations, this project
                        also entailed extracting the item
                        values from the game files. This was done using Python,
                        and the resulting values were
                        converted to JSON files for ease of use with JavaScript.

                        With this project I wanted to focus on implementing a
                        simple API that would make it easy to
                        generate message digests for any data in Rust. I was
                        dissatisfied with the APIs of existing
                        packages, and sought reduce the amount of function calls
                        necessary to get a hash value.
                        Other focuses of this project were well-written
                        documentation and testing.

                        event consist of parsing some data and transforming
                        afterwards. I wanted to try implementing
                        my own simple parser, which parses strings using simple
                        templates and converts the parsing
                        results to specific data types. This was my first go at
                        creating a Rust crate, and I focused
                        on creating an idiomatic API as well as good
                        documentation so that others might be able to
                        use the crate.

                        As part of the Software Development course at UCPH we
                        created some small games in C\# using
                        the provided DIKUGames library. This class taught me
                        more efficient development patterns for
                        OOP, as well as how to delegate work in a group
                        environment in order to maintain development
                        speed. As part of this project we were taught basic OOP
                        principles such as SOLID and TDD.

                        All of my projects are hosted on my private server,
                        located at my residence. As part of this
                        project I have learned a lot about server administration
                        work, web servers, package managers
                        and container architectures. From this I have adequate
                        level of experience with the
                        mentioned technologies.
